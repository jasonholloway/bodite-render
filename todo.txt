BB-RENDER TODO ********************************

Need to get basic renderer up and working.


> PageRegistry
	Test!!!

	
> House in AppDomain

> Resolver to give template *file*, rather than just string - this allows debugging
	but also need to support when we have no local file...
	So, maybe a virtual file, with optional path?
	
	ITemplateManager resolves to ITemplateSource - to do!
	
	Get stuff working first.
	
	


> Local renderer
	- expose path-resolving service to template

> Cloud renderer
	- Heroku, custom FS stuff
